# STEM (SpatioTemporal Exploratory Model)

## Overview
The STEM is an ensemble of locally defined, randomly located, spatially overalpping decision trees and generates a final prediction by aggregating over all overlapping pixels with a specified statistical function (e.g., mean, median, mode). These scripts offer a Python implementation of the STEM algorithm developed by Fink and others (2010)
